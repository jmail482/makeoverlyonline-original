## The headline

**Signal Density: 38.3% — Tier: Losing** [Excalibur V3.1 audit, May 2026]. Across four commercial categories (corporate, weddings, group dining, event spaces), Distillery Events has zero Map Pack appearances. On the brand's own searches, thedistillerydistrict.com outranks them (Map Pack 2 / Top-3 9 / Top-10 15 vs DE's 1 / 7 / 12) [Excalibur V3.1 SERP analysis, May 2026].

## The thesis

The events business is being treated by Google as a feature of the neighborhood, not as a venue brand. Every symptom in the audit flows from this single ontological error. Schema absence, GBP undersizing, brand SERP cannibalization — all downstream effects.

## The schema discovery (post-publication correction)

The original v3 audit said "zero JSON-LD anywhere." That was wrong. A second LLM running the same audit caught what the initial crawler missed: the homepage carries a `Restaurant` schema block (wrong type for an events business) with a fabricated `aggregateRating: { "ratingValue": "5", "reviewCount": "500" }` [raw HTML crawl, May 2026].

Real GBP rating is 3.8 stars on 32 reviews [Google Business Profile, May 2026]. Yelp is 4.x on 86 reviews [Yelp listing, May 2026]. There is no legitimate source for "5/500."

Per Google's review-snippet guidelines, fabricated review schema is a documented manual-action target [^1]. The audit's new Priority 0: **remove this before doing any other SEO work.**

## The architectural fix

Three moves, in order:

1. **Schema-level identity declaration.** Organization + LocalBusiness + EventVenue JSON-LD across all key pages, with sameAs arrays linking the parent (distilleryhospitality.com) + four sister restaurant brands + all social handles + GBPs.
2. **GBP "Department of" relationships** on all five family GBPs (DE + El Catrin + Cluny Bistro + Madrina + Pure Spirits).
3. **Reciprocal cross-linking** with explicit entity-language anchor text across the property family.

The unreplicable moat: **no other Toronto event venue has four sister restaurants + four event spaces + two partner galleries + outdoor grounds on one property under one parent organization.** Activation requires roughly one week of dev work plus 1–2 hours of GBP admin.

## Projected revenue impact

| Phase | Window | Recovery range |
|---|---|---|
| Tier-0 foundational | Days 1-30 | $78K - $132K |
| Tier-1 per-venue + geo | Days 31-90 | $80K - $125K incremental |
| Tier-2 hub + AI search | Days 91-180 | $50K - $85K incremental |
| Tier-3 brand SERP + authority | Days 181-365 | $25K - $40K incremental |
| **Cumulative 12-month** | - | **$233K - $382K** |

## Key takeaways

WebFetch and SiteOne Crawler both missed the schema because they don't reliably scan `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks. Always raw-fetch HTML and grep for `ld+json` as part of any schema audit.

Independent LLM verification is now part of the methodology. One model running the audit is a sanity check; two models running it independently is a verification.
