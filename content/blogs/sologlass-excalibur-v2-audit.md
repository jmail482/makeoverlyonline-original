description: "Solo Glass had a 4.9-star Google rating, 149+ reviews, two locations, and ICBC certification. From their South Surrey address, they ranked for zero keywords — organic, Map Pack, and AI Overviews all blank. The Excalibur V2 engine diagnosed why."
summary: "A two-location BC auto glass shop with exemplary real-world credentials produced an overall digital health score of 38/100. The audit found the /about/ page ranking for 11 service keywords, footer links pointing to a development server on every page, HTTP and HTTPS indexed as separate pages, and zero digital presence from the Surrey location. A 24-step roadmap sequenced the fix."

## The business

Solo Glass is an ICBC-certified, ITA government-certified auto glass shop operating two locations in BC: Langley (#104 – 22575 Fraser Hwy) and South Surrey (1706 152 Street) [site crawl, Apr 2026]. Their Google rating: 4.9 stars across 149+ reviews [Google Business Profile, Apr 2026]. They offer a lifetime warranty on workmanship, mobile service, and proprietary GlassHealer resin. Family-owned against national franchise competitors NOVUS (Mondofix) and Speedy Glass (Belron).

*Excalibur V2 audit generated April 25, 2026. Data: SEO PowerSuite Rank Tracker v8.50.18 geo-located from both business addresses [SEO PowerSuite][^1]. Overall Digital Health Score: 38/100.*

## What the audit found

Five total pages [site crawl, Apr 2026]. Zero schema markup anywhere [site crawl, Apr 2026]. Homepage loading in approximately 5 seconds — estimated 35% conversion loss before a visitor sees content, based on a documented 7% conversion reduction per second of load delay [SteerPoint, 2025][^2].

From the Langley address: 11 keywords tracked, zero organic traffic [SEO PowerSuite Rank Tracker, Apr 2026][^1]. Best position: #18 for "windshield replacement langley" (150 searches/month, CPC $6.84 [SEO PowerSuite Rank Tracker][^1]) — on the /about/ page, not the /services/ page. Three keywords appearing as thumbnail results only (near-zero click value). Click-through rates at position 18 approach 0% [Advanced Web Ranking CTR study][^3].

From the South Surrey address: complete blackout. Zero organic rankings. Zero Map Pack rankings. Zero AI Overview appearances [SEO PowerSuite Rank Tracker, Apr 2026][^1]. "Auto glass repair surrey" — not in the top 30.

## Four critical failures

**1. HTTP/HTTPS dual indexing.** Rank Tracker confirmed both `http://sologlass.ca/` and `https://sologlass.ca/` were indexed as separate pages, splitting all ranking signals between them [SEO PowerSuite Rank Tracker][^1]. Per Google's canonical documentation, duplicate URL indexing dilutes ranking signals [^4].

**2. Dev server links in footer.** Every page carried footer Quick Links — all pointing to `dev3.boost-digital.ca` instead of `sologlass.ca` [site crawl, Apr 2026]. The /services/ page additionally carried an image hosted on `ejw.f33.mytemp.website` [site crawl, Apr 2026].

**3. Wrong page ranking for all service keywords.** The /about/ page ranked for 11 keywords. The /services/ page ranked for one [SEO PowerSuite Rank Tracker][^1]. Per Moz local ranking factors research, a location page with consistent NAP and schema is foundational to local visibility [^5].

**4. Every title tag and image alt text said "Langley."** Five pages, all titled for Langley only [site crawl, Apr 2026]. Per Google's Images documentation, alt text carries geographic relevance signals [^6].

## The competitive context

NOVUS Glass South Surrey holds ICBC Tier 1 Top Performer status — listed first on ICBC's official repair locator [ICBC Glass Repair Program Guide, Oct 2024][^7]. Tier 1 requires a 35%+ windshield repair ratio and delivers a 2% NAGS part rebate, $75/repair claim, and faster payment cycles [ICBC Glass Repair Program Guide][^7]. Braymar Glass has operated in South Surrey/White Rock for 25+ years [Peace Arch News][^8].

All 11 tracked keywords showed green difficulty ratings (10–23 range) [SEO PowerSuite Rank Tracker][^1] — low difficulty that proper page structure would rank for.

## The 24-step roadmap

**Phase 1 — 3 months:** Force HTTPS canonical sitewide. Fix dev server links. Diagnose and resolve 5-second homepage load. Build /langley/ and /south-surrey/ dedicated location pages with LocalBusiness + AutoRepair JSON-LD schema. Build /white-rock/ service area page. Fix all page titles and image alt text sitewide. Add FAQPage schema to existing 13 FAQs [site crawl, Apr 2026]. Configure GBP profiles to location pages. Launch Surrey review generation program (target: 15+ Surrey reviews within 90 days).

**Phase 2 — 6 months:** Dedicated service pages. ICBC claims landing page. ADAS calibration investigation. Service area pages. Blog launch.

**Phase 3 — 12 months:** Content hub (15–20 interlinked pages around ICBC + BC auto glass). YouTube video content. GEO optimization. Sustained review velocity — target: 350+ combined reviews across both GBPs.

## What this demonstrates

Auto glass in BC is an insurance-paid category — ICBC covers windshield repair and replacement directly [ICBC Glass Repair Program Guide][^7]. The conversion bottleneck is not price or persuasion. It is visibility. The 24 items were a dependency chain, not a list.
