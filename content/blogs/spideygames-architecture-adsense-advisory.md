## The situation

SpideyGames.com was a free online games website monetized through Google AdSense. The site had grown from a clean two-URL structure to **four URL types** without a clear rationale [site audit, Mar 2022]. A 404 error page had been indexed by Google with a content-style page title. Meta descriptions had serious duplication issues across pages [site audit, Mar 2022].

**Advisory date: March 27–29, 2020. Platform: Angular. Implementation responsibility: Harish.**

## What the audit mapped

**Correct architecture** [site audit, Mar 2022]:
- Home page → game-type category pages → game info pages and game play pages
- Utility pages as separate paths

**Issues identified** [site audit]:
- Indexed 404 page with a content-style title — advised 301 redirect
- Four URL types where two served the crawl purpose — advised consolidation
- Meta description duplication — systemic

## What the audit recommended

- 301 redirect on the indexed 404 page
- Shared the **Google Quality Raters Guide** — manual review criteria[^1]
- Provided an **SEO content editor tool**
- **Link strategy:** audience-first partnerships with high-traffic gaming sites over backlink acquisition
- Explicit flag: **AdSense monetization requires UX as the primary design priority**[^2]

## The outcome

Advisory delivered. Harish confirmed he had begun redirecting number-based URLs [engagement records, Mar 2020]. Angular implementation was Harish's responsibility throughout.
